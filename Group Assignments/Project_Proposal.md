## Research Question
We hope to explore how access to grocery stores varies across demographics and neighborhoods in the City of LA, with a particular focus on access by non-automobile modes (e.g., walking and public transit) for seniors.  We will quantify each census tract‚Äôs access to grocery stores by using spatial analysis to calculate the average distance to the nearest grocery store, the percentage of residents who live within walking distance of a grocery store, and whether or not census tracts have a direct public transit connection to the nearest grocery store.  We will also consider the range of the metro-micro program in our analysis.  Once we have analyzed the relative accessibility of grocery stores by census tract, we will look at how census tracts with higher levels of older residents compare to the rest of the city.  Within those census tracts, we will also identify those with lower levels of car ownership. We plan to do this by using American Community Survey data on age and car ownership by census tract.  If possible, we will also overlay a map of residential zones over the census tracts to refine population apportionment calculations and identify a more specific point of reference within each census tract than the centroid for relevant calculations (e.g., average distance to the nearest grocery store). Alternatively, we will use the center of the census tract as our point of reference, or simply look at the number of grocery stores per capita in each census tract. 

## Why This Matters
Our analysis could help identify places where additional transit options are needed to increase equitable access to grocery stores through new Metro Micro services areas or additional bus routes. As the population of Los Angeles is rapidly increasing (and aging), mobility access to seniors will become increasingly vital. 


## Spatial & Temporal Scope
We will be focusing our analysis on the city of Los Angeles using demographic data from the most recent census and the American Community Survey. We will also be conducting a spatial analysis on the available public transportation networks in the city. We are choosing to focus on the City of Los Angeles rather than the County to avoid having to find individual datasets for all of the smaller transit agencies in the county. Additionally, grocery stores data is available for the City of Los Angeles, and this dataset is more convenient for analysis than finding data for every other city in the County. 
We will use census block data where possible due to the small scale of our analyses concerning walkability
In our census indicators exploration, we will analyze age and car access variables over the course of time (2011-2021). Recent research has shown that California‚Äôs senior population is expected to grow rapidly in coming years, which will increase the urgency of providing equitable access to mobility for older adults

## Data Sources
We will use data from the American Community Survey to explore how accessibility differs based on age and car ownership
We will use the LA City Grocery Stores dataset based on the Listing of Active Businesses. 
We will explore the LA City GeoHub to include the Metro bus lines data in our analysis. 
Analysis & Visualizations
This project will analyze the availability of public transportation connections to grocery stores in areas with high concentrations of senior citizens. Our visualizations will include overlay maps with transit networks and census tract population data depicting where seniors live. We hope to identify gaps in transit networks and areas that a program like Metro Micro could expand to. 

## Conclusion & Expectations 
We hope to understand the disparities in access to grocery stores by public transit for seniors. Understanding disparities in service can help to inform service expansions through traditional fixed-route transit or innovative programs like Metro Micro to ensure equitable access to mobility for all residents of Los Angeles.
